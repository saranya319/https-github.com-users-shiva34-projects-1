Student Database Management system
The file manage.c contains all the code for this.
It uses three structure namely student , instructor , courses which store data of each of their object.
The program manages the student details (name and roll number) and maps them to their courses and professors taking the courses.
It stores the data in student.txt, courses.txt and instructor.txt.
The program automatically removes any repetition.
